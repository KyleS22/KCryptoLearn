# KCryptoLearn
A place to implement some of the algorithms learned in a Cryptography class.

NOTE: THESE ALGORITHMS ARE NOT SECURE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ACTUALLY ENCRYPT SENSITIVE DATA.  THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

## Algorithms I Would Like To Implement
- [ ] Caesar Cipher 
- [ ] Vigenere Cipher
- [ ] Modified Viginere Cipher
- [ ] Affine Shift
- [ ] Diffie-Helman
- [ ] ElGammal
- [ ] Shanks
- [ ] Miller Rabin
- [ ] Pollard p-1 factoring
