# KCryptoLearn [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KyleS22/KCryptoLearn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KyleS22/KCryptoLearn)
A python package of implemented cryptographic functions.  After taking a class in Cryptogaphy, I thought it might be fun to try to implement some of the algorithms.

NOTE: THESE ALGORITHMS ARE NOT SECURE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ACTUALLY ENCRYPT SENSITIVE DATA.  THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

## Getting Started
Simply clone the repository and open the project directory with your favourite python IDE or text editor.  The scripts can be run with python3.

### Dependencies
This project is being developed with Python 3.6.2

numpy   -> 1.13.3\\
pandas  -> 0.21.0\\
sympy   -> 1.1.1\\

### Running the tests
Automated unit tests can be found in the [tests folder](tests)

The tests can be run using python unittest

```
python3 -m unittest discover tests/
```

## Algorithms I Would Like To Implement
- [ ] Caesar Cipher 
- [ ] Vigenere Cipher
- [ ] Modified Viginere Cipher
- [ ] Diffie-Hellman
